| **Container Image** | `gcr.io/mythical-device-458509-b7/office-agent` |
| **Cloud Run Service** | `office-agent` in `asia-southeast1` |
| **Service URL** | https://office-agent-212383357993.asia-southeast1.run.app |
| **Cloud Scheduler** | `daily-office-scraper` (runs at 6AM UTC / 10AM UAE) |
| **Storage Bucket** | `gs://office_agent` |

## Configuration

### Cloud Run Service
- Memory: 2GB
- CPU: 1 core
- Timeout: 5 minutes

### Scheduler Configuration
- Schedule: `0 6 * * *` (6AM UTC / 10AM UAE)
- HTTP Method: POST
- Request Body: `{"mode":"daily"}`
- Time Zone: UTC

### Current API Endpoints
- `GET /` or `GET /health`: Health check endpoint
- `GET /version`: Returns version information
- `POST /scrape`: Placeholder for the scraper functionality

## Status

The basic API infrastructure is deployed and working. The Cloud Scheduler job is configured to trigger the scraper daily. However, the actual scraping functionality is not yet implemented.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the scraper functionality following the implementation plan
2. Integrate the scraper with the existing API
3. Configure proper storage of scraped data
4. Set up monitoring and alerting

## Usage Instructions

### Checking Service Health
```
curl https://office-agent-212383357993.asia-southeast1.run.app
```

### Checking Version
```
curl https://office-agent-212383357993.asia-southeast1.run.app/version
```

### Triggering Scraper Manually
```
curl -X POST https://office-agent-212383357993.asia-southeast1.run.app/scrape
```

### Viewing Stored Results
```
gsutil ls gs://office_agent
```

Once the scraper is fully implemented, results will be stored in the Cloud Storage bucket and can be accessed using the `gsutil` command or through the Google Cloud Console.
