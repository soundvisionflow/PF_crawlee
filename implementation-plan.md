# Office Agent Implementation Plan

## Current Status
- Basic API is deployed and working on Cloud Run
- API endpoints: `/health`, `/version`, `/scrape` (placeholder)
- Cloud Scheduler job is configured to call the API daily at 6AM UTC

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add Basic Scraper Functionality
1. Add puppeteer back to the package.json as a dependency
2. Update the Dockerfile to install Chrome and its dependencies
3. Create a simplified scraper module with anti-detection mechanisms
4. Integrate the scraper with the `/scrape` endpoint
5. Test locally with a single site before deploying

### Phase 2: Enhanced Scraping
1. Improve error handling and retry logic
2. Add more robust anti-detection techniques
3. Implement proxy rotation for better resilience
4. Add detailed logging and monitoring
5. Set up proper bucket storage for results

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Analytics
1. Implement a `/status` endpoint to show scraping history
2. Set up monitoring alerts for failed scrapes
3. Add basic analytics to track number of listings found
4. Implement a simple dashboard for monitoring

### Phase 4: Additional Features
1. Add ability to filter results by various criteria
2. Implement email notifications for new listings
3. Add support for more real estate websites
4. Create a simple web interface for viewing results

## Deployment Strategy
1. Use separate Cloud Run deployments for testing and production
2. Implement rolling updates to avoid downtime
3. Use environment variables to control behavior
4. Set up proper IAM permissions for secure operations

## Implementation Details

### Stealth Techniques
- Randomized browser fingerprints
- Humanized scrolling and interaction patterns
- Varied user agents and headers
- Delay between requests
- Automatic handling of CAPTCHAs (if possible)

### Error Handling
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing sites
- Detailed error logging and tracking
- Fallback mechanisms when primary approach fails

### Storage Strategy
- Store raw listings in Cloud Storage
- Implement deduplication logic
- Keep historical data for trend analysis
- Implement proper data retention policies

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 3-5 days
- Phase 2: 5-7 days
- Phase 3: 3-5 days
- Phase 4: 7-10 days

Total estimated time: 3-4 weeks for full implementation
